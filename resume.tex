\section{Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Key-Value Database Server} }{Dec. 2017}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Implemented a centralized database server and replicated servers with in-memory database in Golang 
  \item Dealt with concurrent read/write requests from multiple clients, which also keeps clients' data consistent with server's database
  \item A practical application for this twist is a set of replicated
web servers that have eventually-consistent distributed in-memory state loaded from a centralized key-value store
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Indoor Positioning System based on WiFi Fingerprint Data}}{Nov. 2017}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Trained a GP regression model with RSS data and use MAP estimation to determine the location
  \item  Implemented a particle filter that incorporates IMU measurements and a given map to track a moving device
  \item Using python matplotlib to visualize the positioning results
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Taxi Data Analysis and Demand Prediction}}{Sep. 2017}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Built a taxi demand prediction system using Spark MLlib that could predict taxi demand based on location, time and weather condition
  \item Wrote python scripts to process over one million NYC taxi data and extract features
  \item Applied random forest regression model to make prediction and evaluated this model by computing RMSE
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Social Network Friends Recommendation with Game Theory}}{Apr. 2017}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a Link prediction systems that could recommend new friends on social network based on game theory
    \item Wrote Python programs to analyze data and built game theoretic framework
    \item Evaluated this model by computing Area Under ROC curve, achieved a result of 0.93
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Real Time Image Processing with FPGA Acceleration}}{Aug. 2016}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Realized better real-time edge detection using FPGA in ZedBoard to achieve hardware acceleration
    \item Wrote C programs and developed improved  Canny edge detection algorithm
\end{itemize}
